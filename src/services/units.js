/**
 * Unit handling for the shopping list.
 *
 * Recipes measure the same ingredient in whichever unit their author found
 * convenient: one writes "500 g lait", another "500 cL". A shopping list wants
 * a single line per thing to buy, so every metric amount is converted to one
 * canonical unit before the rows are merged.
 *
 * That canonical unit is the gram, and a millilitre is treated as a gram. It
 * is not true in physics — a litre of oil is not a kilo — but it is what a
 * cook means when they write milk as either, and it is the only way to put
 * two differently-measured lines of the same ingredient onto one row.
 *
 * Where a real density is known (densities.js), it is used instead of that
 * approximation, in both directions: a volume becomes the mass it actually
 * weighs, and a mass is shown back as the volume a shop sells it in.
