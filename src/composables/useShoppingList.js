   * also means a recipe's ingredients update on the shopping list the moment
   * a fresh fetch changes them, instead of waiting for someone to re-add it.
   * A recipe gone from `recipes` (deleted upstream, or not loaded yet)
   * simply contributes nothing.
   *
   * Amounts are converted to a canonical unit before they are keyed, so the
   * same ingredient measured two different ways — "500 g lait" in one recipe,
   * "500 cL" in another — merges rather than splitting into two rows that
   * each read in their own unit.
   *
   * Hand-added extras are folded in after the menu, through the same merge:
   * they are things to buy like any other, and nothing about them depends on
   * a recipe still existing upstream.
